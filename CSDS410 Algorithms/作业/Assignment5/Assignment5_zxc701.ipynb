    "2. [8] Why does Kruskal’s MST algorithm still work correctly even if the graph has negative-weight edges, and even negative-weight cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm works correctly even in the presence of negative-weight edges and negative-weight cycles because it relies on the property that the minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is always a subgraph that includes all the vertices and forms a tree without any cycles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sorting by Edge Weight:\n",
    "Kruskal's algorithm starts by sorting all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Selection:\n",
    "It then considers the edges one by one in sorted order, adding each edge to the growing set of edges that form the MST if adding the edge doesn't create a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting Cycles:\n",
    "The algorithm ensures acyclic property by using a data structure, usually a disjoint-set data structure (e.g., union-find), to keep track of the connected components. If adding an edge creates a cycle (i.e., the two vertices of the edge are already in the same connected component), the algorithm skips that edge and moves on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative-weight Edges:\n",
    "The sorting step takes care of negative-weight edges. Since the edges are sorted in non-decreasing order of weight, the algorithm considers the lighter edges first. It doesn't matter if some edges have negative weights, as the algorithm's logic is based on selecting edges in increasing order of weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative-weight Cycles:\n",
    "Even if there are negative-weight cycles in the graph, Kruskal's algorithm will still work correctly. This is because the algorithm is inherently designed to avoid cycles. When it encounters an edge that would form a cycle, it skips that edge and moves on to the next one. Negative-weight cycles can be ignored in the context of MST because, by definition, a minimum spanning tree is a tree, which is an acyclic connected subgraph."

For each edge, e, included in Peter's tree, if removing it would disconnect the graph into two components, V1 and V2, and since edges are considered in reverse order, e must be the minimum-weight edge connecting V1 and V2. This observation, coupled with a crucial fact about MSTs, establishes that e belongs to the MST.\n",
