    "2. Let ùêª be a graph with two vertices and one edge between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition here is that if ùê∫' has a Hamiltonian Cycle, then ùê∫ will have a subgraph isomorphic to ùêª. The two vertices in ùêª correspond to the starting and ending points of the Hamiltonian Cycle, and the edge represents the path connecting them.\n",

    "### Correctness of Reduction:\n",
    "1. If ùê∫' has a Hamiltonian Cycle, then ùê∫ has a subgraph isomorphic to ùêª:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the isomorphism ùëì such that ùëì(vertex_1_in_ùêª) = starting_point_of_HC and ùëì(vertex_2_in_ùêª) = ending_point_of_HC. This is a valid isomorphism because the Hamiltonian Cycle ensures that the path exists in ùê∫.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If ùê∫ has a subgraph isomorphic to ùêª, then ùê∫' has a Hamiltonian Cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "The isomorphism ùëì maps the two vertices in ùêª to the starting and ending points of the Hamiltonian Cycle in ùê∫. The path between these two points forms a Hamiltonian Cycle in ùê∫'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial-Time Reduction:\n",
    "The construction of ùê∫ and ùêª can be done in polynomial time because it involves copying the graph structure and adding two vertices with one edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Since SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM is both in NP and NP-hard (via reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle), we conclude that SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM is NP-complete.\n"
