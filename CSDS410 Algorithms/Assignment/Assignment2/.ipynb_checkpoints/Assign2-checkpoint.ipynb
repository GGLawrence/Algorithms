    "\n",
    "When d is initially 0, the algorithm prints the digits stored in array A. Since we've ensured that it correctly stores the digits in reverse order during the recursive calls, this step is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Step: \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the algorithm correctly prints all the digits of a positive integer n when d is greater than 0, for some arbitrary positive integer d.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the case where d is d - 1, and the algorithm processes the last digit of n (the least significant digit).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm extracts the last digit of n (remainder ← n % 10) and adds it to the end of array A.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step correctly stores the digit in A.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then updates n by removing the last digit (n ← n // 10) and decreases d by 1 (d ← d - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is then recursively called with the updated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the inductive hypothesis, we assume that the algorithm correctly prints all the remaining digits of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the recursive call returns, the algorithm prints the last digit in A, which is the digit that was added to A earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the digits are printed in reverse order, this step effectively prints the last digit of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the algorithm correctly prints all the digits when d is greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running time:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of recursive calls is equal to the number of digits in n. For example, if n has 4 digits, it will make 4 recursive calls, and d is the number of digits in n, recursive time = O(d).\n",

    "\n",
    "If the input array A has fewer than or equal to 1 element, there are no repeated elements to find, and the algorithm correctly returns without any actions. This satisfies the base case condition.\n",

    "### Inductive Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the algorithm correctly identifies and prints repeated elements for arrays of size less than or equal to k.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Step: \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to show that the algorithm correctly identifies and prints repeated elements for an array of size k + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds as follows for an array of size k + 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "It selects a pivot element using the Median of Medians (MOM) algorithm, which ensures that the pivot is chosen to reasonably balance the partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It partitions the array into three sequences: L, E, and G, where:\n",

    "- L contains elements less than the pivot,\n",
    "- E contains elements equal to the pivot, and\n",
    "- G contains elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are repeated elements in the array, they will be present in sequence E (elements equal to the pivot). The algorithm prints these repeated elements correctly by checking if the length of E is greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then recursively applies itself to sequences L and G. By the inductive hypothesis, we assume that it correctly identifies and prints repeated elements within these sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm continues to make progress toward the base case by repeatedly partitioning the array into smaller subarrays, ensuring that it explores all elements. Since it correctly identifies and prints repeated elements at each step, it will eventually identify all repeated elements in the original array.\n",
