There must be an edge e which is only in T1, but not in T2. Add e into T2 to create a circle. In this circle, we set f as the edge with the same node. Because the edges in G have distinct edge weights, thus weight(e) ≠ weight(f). If e > f, then we can create a new spanning tree T1', replacing e with f in T1. weight(T1'）< weight(T1) = weight(T2), it contradicts the fact T1 and T2 are MST.
